# Kniffel REST API - in Rust

This is a Rust rewirte of https://github.com/oglimmer/java-spring-boot-class-sources/tree/main/chapter06

It is fully compatible with the Vue frontend there

... and I should say that this is my first Rust project, so please give me some slack.

# build and run

```bash
cargo run
```
